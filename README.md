# OrcaSlicer
[OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer): an open source Next-Gen Slicing Software for Precision 3D Prints.
Optimize your prints with ultra-fast slicing, intelligent support generation, and seamless printer compatibility—engineered for perfection.

This a collection of my tuned printer profiles, filaments, machines/process presets, and utility scripts for use with Orca Slicer and compatible workflows.

**This repository mirrors the configuration and tuning files used on my local OrcaSlicer installation.** Use these files to migrate settings, backup your tuning, or share profiles between machines.
